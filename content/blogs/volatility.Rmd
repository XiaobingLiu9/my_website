```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}

The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index tracking the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.The index is associated with many ticker symbols, including: ^GSPC, INX, and $SPX, depending on market or website.

I'm trying to have a brief look at the volatility of SPX.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(vroom)
library(tidyquant)
library(rvest)    # scrape websites
library(purrr)  
library(lubridate) #to handle dates
library(ggrepel)
# load required package quantmod
library(quantmod)
```



```{r}
# download time series for SPX since 2014-01-01 from Yahoo Finance (default source)
getSymbols("^GSPC", from='2014-01-01')

# extract the dividend adjusted price/index
spx <- GSPC$GSPC.Adjusted

# dimension/size of the data
dim(spx)

# brief look at spx
head(spx)
tail(spx)

# summary statistics
summary(spx)
```

```{r}
# plot spx
plot(spx)

# calculate annualized vol series of spx log return, using 25-day rolling windows
vol_spx <- volatility(spx, n=25, N=252, calc='close')

# brief look at spx vol series
head(vol_spx)
tail(vol_spx)

plot(vol_spx)

spx_scaled <- (spx - mean(spx))/(max(spx) - min(spx))
plot(spx_scaled)
lines(vol_spx, col='blue', lty=2)
```
