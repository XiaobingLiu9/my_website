My name is Xiaobing Liu, and you can call me Ivy. I come from Beijing, a charming and unique megacity in China. I graduated from Peking University in China and majored in finance. I love travel and sports, I'm good at playing tennis and basketball. During an exchange semester at HEC Paris, I traveled to various countries in Europe.
